### Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of vectors
- Unary arithmetic operations (increment, decrement)
- Assignment operations
- Relational operations (equality, inequality, comparison)
- Vector magnitude calculation
- Normalization of vectors
- Dot product calculation
- Angle calculation between vectors

### Usage

To use the `Vec2` class, simply include the `vec2.h` header file in your C++ project.
