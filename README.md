# Euclidean Vectors

## Project Purpose:
- Learn about operator overloading
- Learn about unit testing (doctest)
- Learn basic mathematical principles related to Euclidean vectors
- Implement a simple, useful data structure from scratch

## Vec2 Class

The `Vec2` class represents a 2-dimensional vector in Euclidean space. It provides various functionalities for vector arithmetic and manipulation.

### Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of vectors
- Unary arithmetic operations (increment, decrement)
- Assignment operations
- Relational operations (equality, inequality, comparison)
- Vector magnitude calculation
- Normalization of vectors
- Dot product calculation
- Angle calculation between vectors

### Usage

To use the `Vec2` class, simply include the `vec2.h` header file in your C++ project.
